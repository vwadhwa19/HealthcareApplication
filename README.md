# HealthcareApplication
A java swing application that is a scheduling system for a healthcare facility

I worked in a group of three on this application using Eclipse and SQLite database on Windows operating system 
It was developed using Java, Java Swing, and SQL. The users of the application include patients, nurse, doctor, and admin. 
The patients have the ability to schedule appointments with a doctor, while the nurse confirms or cancels the final appointments. 
The doctor can view the appointments he/she has at any given time, and the admin creates the doctor's and nurse's account and resets passwords.
